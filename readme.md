Climate Change Analysis Project

Description

This project analyzes trends in climate change using time-series data on CO2 emissions, sea levels, and temperature changes. The objective is to explore historical trends and build predictive models to forecast future climate change impacts.

Datasets

CO2 Emissions Dataset: Contains annual CO2 emissions data by country and globally (in kilotonnes).

Sea Level Dataset: Provides global mean sea level (GMSL) measurements over time.

Climate Indicators Dataset: Includes temperature change data relative to baseline values for multiple countries.

Features

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values and align datasets for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize historical trends in CO2 emissions, sea levels, and temperatures.

Time-Series Modeling: Build SARIMA models to predict future trends for:

CO2 emissions

Global mean sea levels

Average temperature changes.

Tools and Libraries

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib for data visualization

statsmodels for time-series modeling
